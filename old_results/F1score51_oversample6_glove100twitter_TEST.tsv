It works well but it cost me $400 + $600 that BC/BS paid for 3 months. Even my part is costly. I'd be most appreciative of your help. (Metformin almost killed my kidneys.)

3068	1	1197618809085005824	@cryptodemedici Hahaha ahhh and here he shows his ignorance.  Want to know why? HgH isn’t just a growth hormone.  It induces insulin release when there are no dietary carbs in your blood.  Why? To prevent amino acid degradation aka starvation.
3069	1	1197619132776226832	@cryptodemedici HGH doesn’t induce growth during fasting, you have to have both insulin and an abundance of correct nutrients from diet to induce growth.  HGH is literally preventing starvation mechanisms from using important body proteins as fuel while you fast/starve.  Context....

No.  Your body enzymes that keep your vital physiological processes running are proteins.  You need to maintain the functional of those proteins to survive.  It’s why HGH induces insulin release in fasting
