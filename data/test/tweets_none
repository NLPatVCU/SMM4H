Whew, those side effects of metformin are hitting hard today -_-
username That being said, our drugs are much cheaper. I think I paid $140.00 for 3 Lantus pens for my cat. Indigenous people have coverage and most provinces offer subsidized RX for seniors. Max fee for a 90 day supply to 65+ is $25.00
